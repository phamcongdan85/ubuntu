You have probably upgraded to a version of apt that does not keep installed packages by default, you can check by running:

apt-config dump | grep 'Keep-Downloaded-Packages'

and you will likely see:

Binary::apt::APT::Keep-Downloaded-Packages "0";

If that's the case then you can keep packages again by changing that setting to 1/true:

echo 'Binary::apt::APT::Keep-Downloaded-Packages "true";' | sudo tee /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/99-keep-downloads



xargs -a hihi.txt apt download
